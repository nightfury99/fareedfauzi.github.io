Hi, Fareed most interested are in malware analysis, malware research reversing and penetration testing. He is a malware analyst and DFIR team at local computer security company. He's still learning so feel free to criticize his posts to improve his knowledge. In his free time, he enjoy workout, skipping rope, running and spending time with his friends.
